           <h1>What is IELTS?</h1>
<h2 class="text-center">Here’s all you need to know about IELTS</h2>
The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the world’s most popular high-stakes English language proficiency test for study, work and migration, with more than three million tests taken in the past year. The IELTS results are recognised by more than 10,000 organisations, including educational institutions, employers, professional associations and governments, in 140 countries around the world.

You can choose to take your IELTS test either on paper or computer, depending on your convenience. There is no difference in the content, format or level of difficulty between the two options. Remember, you will have to carefully choose which module you wish to take -  IELTS Academic or IELTS General Training, depending on the purpose of your taking the test. However, to study in the UK, you’ll have to take the IELTS test approved for UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI).

<h3>IELTS test format</h3>
IELTS is a test of all four language skills: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. You will take the Listening, Reading and Writing tests all on the same day one after the other, with no breaks in between. For the Speaking test, you can book a slot online on your preferred date and time. If you fail to choose a slot within the stated time period, a time slot will be automatically allocated to you. The total test time is under three hours.

<h3>IELTS Listening test (30 minutes)</h3>
You will have to listen to four recordings and then answer the questions asked. The recordings are of native English speakers and the duration of the test is 30 minutes.

<h3>IELTS Reading test (60 minutes)</h3>
The IELTS Reading test requires you to answer 40 questions and is designed to test you on an array of reading skills. You would have to read for gist, main ideas, details, logical arguments, skimming, and figuring out the writers’ attitudes, opinions and intentions.

<h3>IELTS Writing test (60 minutes)</h3>
The IELTS writing test requires you to complete two tasks and covers topics of general interest based on the module you are taking.

<h3>IELTS Speaking Test (11-14 minutes)</h3>
The IELTS Speaking test assesses your spoken English skills. The test is recorded and conducted in three parts.

<h3>IELTS test dates</h3>
The IELTS test dates in India are available four times a month or 48 times a year (for paper-based), and are generally held on Saturdays and Thursdays to provide flexibility and convenience to the test seekers. With the computer-delivered IELTS, you can choose from multiple dates and time slots in a day and get your results within 5-7 days. However, the availability of the IELTS dates may differ as per the test type and module you have opted for - Academic or General Training.

<h3>Why choose IELTS?</h3>
It is the test for study − thousands of the world’s most reputable universities and colleges will accept your IELTS results as evidence of your English language proficiency.
It is the test for professionals − professional registration bodies in many fields will accept an IELTS result, including accounting, engineering, law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and teaching bodies in many countries. This means that after completing your studies, you may need to take the test in order to gain professional registration in an English-speaking country.

It is the test for migration – IELTS scores are required by governments in more countries than any other English language test as a requirement for permanent residency. Unlike other providers, the IELTS General Training test is the only non-academic test available for migration to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The United Kingdom and The USA.
It’s the test that’s fairer to you – IELTS assesses you on your practical communication abilities and provides with an accurate assessment of the four skills being tested. It focusses on testing the language abilities rather than specialist knowledge of the candidate and offer two versions – Academic and General Training. Plus, it allows for a one-on-one Speaking test one with an examiner in a private room with no distractions.

The test content for IELTS is developed by an international team of experts and undergoes extensive research to ensure the test remains fair and unbiased for any candidate regardless of nationality, background, gender, lifestyle or location.
